# VLSIR interchange formats

This repository defines the schema and format of data interchanged between VLSIR tools.

The data format is actually defined by [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).

The schema is defined by the .proto files here-in *and* surrounding commentary. Please read the documentation thoroughly. (lol -ed)

Reference implementations for some languages exist in [VlsirTools](https://github.com/Vlsir/Vlsir).

## Usage

If a reference implementation exists, we recommend that you use it. Otherwise, you can use these .proto files to integrate your own.

## Versioning

Stable releases will be tagged with a version number, i.e. `v1.0.0`.
